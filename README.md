# nlcfs (NotLiteCode File System)
A simple hackable remote file system with in transit encryption using Dokany.

## Planned features:
[*] At rest encryption
[*] Multi-user environment
[*] Multithreading
[*] More out of the box configuration that doesn't require re-compiling

## Warnings:
This project is very alpha and doesn't fully work, it is only to be seen as a proof of concept until it is in a more completed state.
