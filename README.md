# nlcfs (NotLiteCode File System)
A simple hackable remote file system with in transit encryption using Dokany.

## Planned features:
* At rest encryption
* Multi-user environment
* Multithreading
* More out of the box configuration that doesn't require re-compiling

## Warnings:
This project is very alpha and doesn't fully work, it is only to be seen as a proof of concept until it is in a more completed state.
